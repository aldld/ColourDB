Copic ColourDB is an Android app for managing an inventory of markers using the
Copic colour code system.

To add a colour to your inventory, simply tap the square labeled with the
appropriate colour code. To remove it, simply tap it again. To mark a colour as
needing a refill, long press its square, and check "Needs Refill" in the
dialogue.

Use the navigation drawer to either view all colours, only colours that you =
currently have in stock, or those that need refills.
